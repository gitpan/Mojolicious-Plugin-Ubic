DESCRIPTION
    This Mojolicious plugin allow you to query status of the running Ubic
    services and also start/stop/restart/reload/... them.

    This is Ubic::Ping::Service on steroids.

  proxy
    This resource is used to proxy commands to other servers.

  services
      GET /services
      GET /services/:service_name

    Returns a json object with the services available and statuses:

      {
        "multi_service_name": {
          "child_service_name": {
            "status":"running"
          }
        }
      }

    Is is also possible to ask for "?flat=1" which will result in this
    response:

      {
        "services": {
          "multi_service_name.child_service_name": {
            "status":"running"
          }
        }
      }

      POST /:service_name/reload
      POST /:service_name/restart
      POST /:service_name/stop

    command line. The return value contain "status". Example:

      {"status":"running"}
